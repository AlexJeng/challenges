## Word Counter

We have an RSS feed of our blog available at

    http://blog.xxx.com/feed

(an Atom feed is also available at `http://blog.xxx.com/feed/atom`)

We would like to know what is the most common word in each of the postings.

We're only interested in the words that occur in the body of the
posting, i.e. inside the <content> tag.

We want to avoid common words, so please exclude anything in this list:

    http://www.textfixer.com/resources/common-english-words.txt

For bonus points, we'd also like to know the most common word across all of the postings.
